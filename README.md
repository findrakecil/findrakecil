## Assalaamu 'alaikum 👋

I'm Findra, a **Senior Software Engineer**. I am passionate about writing clean code, designing robust system architectures, and contributing to the open-source community.

✍️ I write a [blog](https://findrakecil.dev/blog) about Debian and web development.  
🎨 I ported [Alabaster Dark for Zed](https://zed.dev/extensions/alabaster-dark) from [Alabaster Color Scheme](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster).  
🗃️ I collect [Alabaster Themes](https://alabaster-themes.pages.dev).  
⚓ I create [Anchor](https://anchor.findrakecil.dev) to help us get things done.
